My project semester simplified is a platform for university students where students can find subject related notes assignments previous year papers and all study material related info in form of pdfs and also can download it to their local systems. it is a type of peer-to-peer where student themselves upload the documents which are then made available to all the students. we also implemented a community support where people from same university can connect with each other for better support. a user can also view list of his/her uploads. this project has various implementations such as login authentication tokens, real time chat application.
